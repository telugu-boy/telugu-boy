Good morning, most of my (proprietary) software development happens on my private Gitea instance: https://git.ieltsforge.org/.

To learn about DevOps and [data intensive applications](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781491903063/), and, mostly for fun, I decided to self-host Gitea, Drone CI and Argo CD as well as a few other services that I develop and license (on a small scale) on a group of cheap VPSes and an old laptop.

I plan to move some of these services over to Kubernetes on Azure or AWS in the near future, after they gain popularity or when I feel like my current solution isn't adequate.

I'm also planning to set up a blog (which might also double as a personal portfolio) to reflect on books I'm reading, interesting problems I'm solving and new technologies I'm experimenting with. I'm going to write up a few posts about what I develop on my Gitea instance to not be completely opaque about what I do, and show that I do indeed know how to code.
