Good morning, most of my software development happens on my Gitea instance: https://git.ieltsforge.org/ (shut down for server repairs).

To learn about enterprise development, DevOps and [data intensive applications](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781491903063/), I decided to self-host Gitea, CI/CD services, and a container orchestrator which are used to run SaaSs.

I have set up a [blog](https://b.ohncal.com/) to reflect on books I am reading and as a place to express my opinions.
