*BARMAN vs TITANIC with B.M REMIX*

Projects that I am working on include:
* winfakeav. This can be used to play audio and video samples, individual or muxed, through a virtual microphone and camera on Windows.
* [bswssnd](https://github.com/bswssnd), a lightweight Discord music bot and audio player/sender meant to be self-hosted.
  * This was created after the advent of Youtube's cease and desist orders to major Youtube-supporting music bots on Discord.
